# MegaAGS Version History

(This is a partial version history reconstructed from earlier releases, some features may be missing)

## 2023.04.05

* New, dedicated `Amiga` and `Amiga 500` setups for ease of switching on MiSTer, this lets you have the best of both worlds: Easy HD-based games/demo setup, and a cycle-accurate floppy-based Amiga 500 for running ADF games and demos when needed.
* Optional `Amiga 500HD` and `Amiga 600HD` setups for those of you looking to explore Workbench 1.3 and 2.x as period-accurate HD setups — these both support the MiSTer shared drive and use the PFS file system for robustness
* Content: Up to date with [WHDLoad] as of 2023.03.03
* Content: Lots of new disk magazines and demos
* Menu: significantly faster load times when entering lists
* Menu: Jump-to-letter using keyboard
* Menu: Go to parent list using secondary/blue/B button from a gamepad/joystick (you can enable the old behaviour with an explicit "Back" entry in `Options`)
* Menu: Support for chronological sorting (not dynamic, but pre-set in certain lists like "Disk magazines, by release date")
* Menu: Natural sorting: the launcher will now sort e.g. Turrican, Turrican II, Turrican 3 in that order instead of a straight ASCII sort
* Menu: New "look and feel"
* Misc: Super Attract Mode integration
* Misc: Added `MegaAGS-Extras` archive with alternative MGL based configs and PFS-formatted `Saves` HDF images in various sizes
