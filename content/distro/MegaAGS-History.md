# MegaAGS Version History

(This is a partial version history reconstructed from earlier releases, some features may be missing)

## 2023.04.05

* This new version makes use of MiSTer's recently introduced `MGL` support to supply convenient, dedicated `Amiga` and `Amiga 500` setups for ease of switching on MiSTer. This lets you have the best of both worlds: An everyday, easy HD-based games/demo setup, as well as a cycle-accurate floppy-based Amiga 500 for running ADF games and demos when necessary.
* New, optional `Amiga 500HD` and `Amiga 600HD` setups are included for those of you looking to explore Workbench 1.3 and 2.x as period-accurate HD setups — these both support the MiSTer shared drive and use the PFS file system for robustness. See the `Extras` part if you are interested in these.
* Up to date with the latest WHDLoad games and demos as of 2023.03.03.
* Lots of new disk magazines and demos.
* Significantly faster load times when entering lists in the launcher.
* Jump-to-letter using keyboard in the launcher.
* Launcher now supports going to the parent list using secondary/blue/B button from a gamepad/joystick, or using backspace on the keyboard. You can enable the old behaviour with an explicit "Back" entry in `Options` if you prefer the old behavior.
* Launcher supports chronological sorting, pre-set in certain lists like "Disk magazines, by release date", which is a great way to follow the history of the Amiga demo scene in the 90s, as written by the demo scene members.
* Natural sorting: the launcher will now sort e.g. Turrican, Turrican II, Turrican 3 in that order instead of a straight ASCII sort.
* New "look and feel" for the launcher.
* MiSTer Super Attract Mode integration added.
* `MegaAGS-Extras` section added, with alternative MGL based configs and convenient PFS-formatted `Saves` HDF images in various sizes. See the dedicated documentation included for more detail.
