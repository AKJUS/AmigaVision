== Amiga CD32 setup for MiSTer ==

This is a convenience package that will allow you to load CD32 games using the MiSTer Amiga core. Follow the instructions for installing AmigaVision, and you should see an entry under Console â†’ Amiga CD32 in the MiSTer menu.

== Adding games ==

Put your CD32 disc images in the games/AmigaCD32 directory. CHD and BIN/CUE as well as ISO images are supported.

== Usage ==

* Navigate to Consoles -> Amiga CD32 and start it.
* You will be presented with a UI, but don't click anything yet.
* Open the MiSTer menu (F12), and navigate to the Drives section.
* Navigate to the drive marked as "Removable/CD", and select the CD32 disc image you want to play on the line below.
* Dismiss the MiSTer menu (F12).
* Select "Boot".
* Enjoy your game!


== A note on compatibility ==

This is not a *real* CD32 core for the MiSTer. It uses the CD Audio support that was recently added to the Amiga (Minimig) core, and uses a program called CD32-Emulator to run CD32 games. 

Compatibility is not perfect, and not all games will work or necessarily have their CD soundtracks. An updated compatibility list with any special settings required can be found at:

Happy gaming!
