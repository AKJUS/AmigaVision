Run CD32 Games from CHD or BIN/CUE disc images.

Mount the game CD in MiSTer's "Drives" menu section
as a Secondary Master drive. Then select "Boot".

Compatibility is not 100% perfect since it uses a
shim + MiSTer's CDDA support, so not all games will 
work or necessarily have their CD soundtracks.
