4th part with credits is screenwrapped incorrectly if holding a key to speed up - may be bug in demo

Crashes at end, music glitches first, goes slow, until crash. If you press a key to skip the text it ends gracefully, but if left on the text (theres 3 screens of text), it will eventually crash. Seems like a musicplayer issue in demo.
