demo--absoluteinebriation--absoluteinebriation
White screen - fails to load

demo--alchemy--alchemy
Many wrong colours showing, doesn't look right in all the terrain sections (looks like an AGA demo trying to run on a 1.3rom)

demo-notwhdl--paranoimia-anotherfirst
Part of screen masked - old screenshot shows the demo working correctly (nb// i have notcied this issue in other demos where part of screen is masked)

demo--anotherworldintro--anotherworld
Lines across screen

demo--aquarium--aquarium
Extreme slowness of many effects, then gets stuck on flower for ages (but does continue eventually)
Desperately needs looking at, good demo otherwise.

demo--astrogate--astrogate
Another demo with the masking issue (like Paranoimia demo above)

demo--atmosphere--atmosphere
Crashes if pressing Win key or Shift key (getting screenshots was tough)
