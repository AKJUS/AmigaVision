# AmigaVision CD32 Setup for MiSTer 

This is a convenience package that will allow you to load Amiga CD32 games using the MiSTer Amiga core. It uses MiSTerâ€™s MGL support allowing you to start games directly from the MiSTer menu.

## Features

* Stand-alone setup that doesn't have any dependencies on AmigaVision itself. If you want to just have CD32 games, and not the rest of the Amiga library, you can. (â€¦and you'd be missing out on all of the good games!) ðŸ˜„
* Allows you to start CD32 games directly from MiSTer's menu without requiring a mouse or keyboard, gamepad/joystick is all you need.
* No need to keep track of which games need FastMem or Instruction Cache disabled â€” or even that one game that requires volume control to be disabled! â€” we handle it for you.
* Uses AmigaVision's scanline and shadow masks presets.
* Uses AmigaVision's scaling presets, which are considered the best in the business. ðŸ˜…
* Games that can make use of AmigaVision's 5Ã—PAL overscale presets â€” like Chaos Engine CD32 â€” now use that on a per-game basis when a game can handle it. More info on this: [https://amiga.vision/5x]

## Installation

First, you need to pick the correct set of config files. Because of the way MiSTer implements paths differently between using SD cards, external USB drives, and network drives (NAS/CIFS), you need to pick the one that matches your setup.

* Open the SD, USB or NAS folder, depending on your setup.
* Copy everything inside that folder to the root of your MiSTer filesystem.

### Previous CD32 Setup

* If you already have AmigaVision installed, some files like the `Presets`, `Filters` and `Shadow_Masks` will already exist â€” you can skip these or overwrite them, it doesn't matter, they are identical.
* If you had the previous CD32 setup, absolutely overwrite the old `CD32.hdf` for this new setup to work.

## Upgrading

As is the case with the main AmigaVision setup, the same goes for this CD32 setup â€” always do a clean install and replace all the files with the exception of your `CD32-Saves.hdf`. We will update config files when needed, so you want the latest version of all the files, even though it might not be obvious what has changed from the directory listing alone.

## Adding Games 

Put your CD32 disc images in the `games/AmigaCD32` directory. You have to use the MiSTer CD32 CHD pack, or rename your own CHD images according to the naming scheme for the MGLs to work. The expected names are listed at the bottom of this file. We do not support `bin/cue` or `ISO` files.

## Playing a Game

* Navigate to `Console` â†’ `Amiga CD32 Games`
* Select the game you want to play.
* Enjoy your game!

## Optional

If you already had the previous AmigaVision CD32 support, you can delete the `_Consoles/Amiga CD32.mgl` file â€” it is no longer needed, and in fact will not do anything useful if you start it.

## Compatibility

This is not a *real* CD32 core for the MiSTer. It uses the CD Audio support that was recently added to the Amiga (Minimig) core, and uses a program called CD32-Emulator to run CD32 games. 

Compatibility is not perfect, and not all games will work or necessarily have their CD soundtracks. An updated compatibility list with any special settings required can be found at:
